  p I do not want to be considered for home detention curfew (tagging) because:

  p
    input#tick(type='checkbox')
    label(for="tick") I have nowhere to stay

  p Other reason:
  div.box(style={height: '3cm'})

  p If you don't have an address, Bail and Accommodation Support Services (BASS) will try to help you find somewhere to stay. Ask prison staff for more information.

  p I understand that I will not be released until #{SENT_CRD}.
