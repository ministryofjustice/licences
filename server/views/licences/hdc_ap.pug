          | Your compliance with the conditions of the Home Detention Curfew will be monitored by the electronic
          | monitoring contractor. You must provide the contractor with access to the curfew address to install and check
          | the monitoring equipment and electronic tag. Such visits will be made during your curfew hours but not between
          | midnight and 6.00am. However, the contractor may visit the curfew address between midnight and 6:00am in
          | order to investigate a reported violation.

        li
          | The monitoring equipment will usually operate via the mobile cellular network and will only need a dedicated
          | telephone line to be fitted if the mobile signal is poor at the curfew address. You will be responsible for
          | meeting the cost of the small amount of electricity used by the monitoring equipment at your curfew address.
          | It is your responsibility to ensure that there is an electricity supply available during your time on
          | curfew.

        li
          | In the event of a dedicated telephone line needing to be installed you must agree to the installation at
          | your curfew address for use by the supplier. The supplier will notify you of a time and a date and you must be
          | present, and provide access to, the curfew address at the notified time to allow installation to take place.
          | The installation will normally take place during standard working hours and is fully paid for by the
          | supplier.

          | While on Home Detention Curfew you may be liable to recall to prison if you breach the condition of this

            li You withdraw your consent to the monitoring arrangements.

        li
          | In addition, you may be recalled to prison if your whereabouts can no longer be electronically monitored at
          | the specified address.

        li
          | The contractor may authorise your absence from your place of curfew in clearly defined circumstances, which
          | you will be informed about by the contractor in writing.  You must contact the contractor in advance of any such
          | absence to seek authorisation where this is possible.  If it is not possible to contact the contractor in
          | advance, you must contact them as soon as possible thereafter. Absence for any other reason other than these
          | clearly defined circumstances will constitute a breach of your curfew condition.

        li
          | If you need to seek a permanent change to your curfew conditions (for instance because of the requirements of
          | a new job), you must contact the Prison Service establishment from which you were released.  A contact number is
          | attached at the bottom of this licence.
